# Tokeping

## An amateurish re-imagining of both [smokeping](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/) and the successor [vaping](https://github.com/20c/vaping) in golang. Initial version supports primarily ping and DNS and has a nearly identical structure to Vaping (why re-invent the wheel?). The architecture is, like its predecessors, plugin based and modular, with the potential therefor of being a compiled and theoretically faster, lower overhead implementation. Your guess is as good as mine if that is actually the case. 

### Features

* Simple web interface that is really only useful for testing configurations.
* File logging of results
* Support for InfluxDB
* Support for ZeroMQ
* Expandable with go based plugins.
